# Burger Eater App
This is a burger logger where users are able to enter burgers that they would like to eat and then set them as devoured by click on the correct buttons. This project was created as practice for Handlebars and a home made ORM and follows the MVC design pattern.

The live version of the page can be found on [heroku](https://ancient-headland-77711.herokuapp.com/).

## Requirements
The following applications are required for this app to work:
- MySQL
- Node
- Express
- Handlebars
- The included ORM

The ORM is included in the download. The other packages can be downloaded using the 'npm i' command in the terminal.

If you are running this app on your local machine, you will need to create a MySQL database using the provided schema. The seeds file will assist with testing.

## Usage
To use this app, enter the name of a burger you would like to eat in the bottom input field. After submitting the burger, it will appear in the waiting area to the left.

To eat a burger, click on the button next to the burger's name. The burger will then move to the right table.
